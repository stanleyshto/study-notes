1. Step for using GITHUB
    - Add/commit your code
    - Goto Github and make a new repository
    - Connect your local repository to the github repository (add a remote)
    - Push your code up to github using the new remote

2. Push the local repository to GITHUB
    - git remote add origin https://github.com/stanleyshto/xxxxxxxx.git
        origin is the alias of the remote repository
        this is to create the remote repository on Github
    - git push -u origin master
        master is the local repository for pushing
        this is to push the local repository to Github

3. To list out all available remote
    - git remote -v

4. To fetch the remote repository and sync to local 
    - git pull origin master

5. To fork & clone a repository
    - Goto https://github.com/search for search repository
    - Goto the repository
    - Click button "Fork" on the top right corner
    - The repository will then copy to your Github
    - In Git bash terminal, change directory to the destination folder and 
        type "git clone <URL of the remote repository, e.g. https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git>"
