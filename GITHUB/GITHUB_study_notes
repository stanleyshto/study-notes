1. Step for using GITHUB
    - Add/commit your code
    - Goto Github and make a new repository
    - Connect your local repository to the github repository (add a remote)
    - Push your code up to github using the new remote

Push the local repository to GITHUB
    - git remote add origin https://github.com/stanleyshto/xxxxxxxx.git
        origin is the alias of the remote repository
        this is to create the remote repository on Github
    - git push -u origin master
        master is the local repository
        this is to push the local repository to Github
